# Java-Project-6-Vending-Machine
There are 3 files - Item, Machine and VendingMachineMain. 
Item class is the class which aids in maintaining all the data of an item which is stored in the vending machine. 
Machine class is basically an array of Item class. An object(items) is created of the array. It helps in maintaining each item in the machine.
VendingMachineMain is the main java file. Here both the other classes are used to form objects and the project is finalised here.
